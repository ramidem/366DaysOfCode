[ ] JavaScript, ES6

**ES5, ES6, ES2016, ES2017, ES.Next**

- ECMAScript vs JavaScript
- What do most environments support?
- Transpilers (Babel, Typescript, CoffeScript, etc.)
- Which syntax should I use?

_Closures_

- Functions that refer to variables declared by parent function still have access to those variables
- Possible because of JavaScript scoping

_IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)_

- A function expression that gets invoked immediately
- Creates Closure
- Does not add to or modify global object

_First-Class Functions_

- Functions are treated the same way as any other value

  - Can be assigned to variables, array values, object values
  - Can be passed as arguments to other functions
  - Can be returned from other functions

- Allows for the creation of higher-order functions

  - Either takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function
  - map(), filter(), reduce()
