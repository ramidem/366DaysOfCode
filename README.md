# #366DaysOfCode

My attempt to coding everyday for 366 days in 2020!

I found out that I am able to track the stuff I want to learn better by putting them in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/ramidem/914534d1cae3467888dd06ff3bca0152?v=e93505a64934440b804bc2cbaa92e5cc). Also, I have moved the tutorial folders and kept them locally. This repo will just serve as a daily logger. Although, I am now just committing changes once every weekend. I want every green square on this profile to be meaningful.

**[Learn Enough to Be Dangerous](https://www.notion.so/ramidem/914534d1cae3467888dd06ff3bca0152?v=e93505a64934440b804bc2cbaa92e5cc)** is a condensed version of all the courses recommended by [P1xt](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides). I also added other resources from elsewhere.

## Currently...

1. Zuitt Coding Bootcamp until the end of September 2020
